# Coffee Pal

## What was the purpose of this project?
There was a day where my sister got up to make her normal cup of coffee like every other day and it didn't go to plan. The coffee came out not how she anticipated it would. So I decided to build a coffee calculator to help her and my family to make the perfect cup of coffee every single time and never have to go through the pain of drinking terribly brewed coffee. This was build in HTMl, Tailwind, and Javascript. I wanted to use Typescript but I wasn't too familiar with the technology so I continued to use Javascript, something I am more familiar with. Curretly, I have no other ideas for improvements currently other than migrating this to React.
